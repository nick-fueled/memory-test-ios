Memory management:  Good example of autorelease pools and retain cycles

Use buttons to show
1. where autorelease pools make sense even with ARC.
2. how a retain cycle can be detected through instruments

Much sure to use instruments (allocations and leaks).  Quick way of doing this : Go to debug navigator on your left, choose memory and go to instruments from there.
